Selective Inference for DNN example

Example: Simple Anomaly Detection after DNN-based Feature Extracting
Anomaly Detection: The one with the largest sum is choosen as anomaly
Feature Extractor: Just treat it as an neurol network converting X (d-dimension) -> X' (d'-dimension), don't need to completely understand it
